                    <h4>Fund Objective</h4>
                    <p>The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective principally by investing in the stock of 25 large
                        cap growth firms selected by Merlin as being, in the opinion of Merlin, among the most attractive
                        large cap growth firms, regardless of industry or sector. Merlin will seek to identify firms that
                        are highly profitable and capable of sustainable earnings growth that MERLIN believes will outpace
                        that of the broader market and that trades at an attractive valuation relative to its expected earnings
                        growth. All holdings will be individual US-listed equity securities, with market capitalization typically
                        above $5 billion.</p>
                    <h4>About the Fund</h4>
                    <p>The process of selecting attractive investment opportunities with a 3-5 year outlook is a comprehensive
                        multivariate approach combining bottom-up, top-down and quantitative evaluation combined with a macroeconomic
                        overlay. The Fund's growth strategy is driven by individual stock selection and is typically over
                        weighted towards those sectors that Merlin believes to be the most attractive and represent the best
                        opportunity for growth, both in earning and stock price, and underweighted in (or has no exposure
                        to) the least attractive sectors during any period of time. Merlin expects that, under normal market
                        conditions, the holdings of the Fund will allocated equally across all holdings. Merlin expects to
                        periodically rebalance the portfolio to account for relative changes in value across the portfolio
                        holdings.</p>
